# Summary

*For the most up-to-date version of the README, please refer to the version on the master branch.*

COVID-19 dashboard is a web app (made with Spring Boot and Vaadin) that displays COVID-19 statistics on a global level 
and on a per-country basis. 

*Note: the fetched data is cached for 24 hours.*

# Features

The [COVID-19 API](https://covid19api.com/) (the data is sourced from [Johns Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)).

## Global overview

## Change in cases over time for a specific country

See how the number of deaths has changed over time, since the first COVID-19 death, as the number of confirmed cases
have changed over time (also since the first confirmed case).

## Case comparison between countries

![Case comparison](/media/cases_comparison.png)

Compare one country's rate of confirmed cases with others (the screenshot above shows a comparison with
one other country, but you can compare a country with multiple other countries).

## Death comparison between countries

Or compare different countries' COVID-19 death rates.

*Note: the screenshots above are for illustrative purposes only. The actual UI may look slightly different. 
If any major changes are made, new screenshots will be uploaded.*
